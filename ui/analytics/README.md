# penduino-ui

In ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - there is no guarantee that this UI is completely functional. I am in the process of updating from Vue2 to Vue3 as well as updating features based on other UI developments. 

Based upon ['penduino-ui'](https://github.com/timdrysdale/penduino-ui) by Tim Drysdale

This is a Vue.js app providing a UI for the penduino remote lab [here](https://github.com/timdrysdale/penduino)

## New features in development

- Inclusion of a simulated version of the pendulum.
- Introduce more 'manual' interaction, users click to collect data points, ensure scale of pendulum and ruler UI tool.
- Additional features based upon requirements of undergraduate lab courses.
